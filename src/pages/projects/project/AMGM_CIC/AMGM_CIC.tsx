      <h2>What's this?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a Visual Implementation of Algebraic Model for Geometry on
        Manifold with Constant Intrinsic Curvature (AMGM-CIC).<br></br>
        Which is like a final project that me and my friend, Hanchai Nonprasart
        have done over the course of studying at Mahidol Wittayanusorn School.
        <br></br>
        It was originally planned as a simple computer project. But
        somehow it became a full-on mathematical problem (I don't even know how but it
        is what it is).
