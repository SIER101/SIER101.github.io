## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/30MA19-02/noneuclid.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Import the library

   ```js
   import Manifold from "noneuclid";
   ```

## Usage

To create a manifold, call the `Manifold` constructor specifying the dimensionality and the curvature.
The result is a factory defining the point on the requested manifold.

   ```js
   Manifold(dim, lambda);
      // dim    = number of dimensions.
      // lambda = linear sectional curvature
   ```

Here are some examples:

   ```js
   // Two-dimensional geometry
   const spherical  = Manifold(2, +1); // Geometry on a unit sphere (spherical geometry)
   const euclidean  = Manifold(2, +0); // Geometry on a Euclidean plane (Euclidean geometry)
   const hyperbolic = Manifold(2, -1); // Geometry on a unit pseudosphere (hyperbolic geometry)
   ```

The factory can now be used to generate point (`manifold.Point`) and distance-preserving transformations.
Those objects can now perform any expected calculation including

* transformed with another transformation via `point.transform(other)`,
* evaluate inner product with other transformation via `point.inner_prod(other)`,
* project into an $n+1$-dimensional space via `point.project`,
* and embed into an $n$-dimensional space via `point.embed`.
